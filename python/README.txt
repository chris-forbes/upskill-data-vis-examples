Both files are intended to be run from a command line interface (CLI) 

Both files will require a version of python 3 installed which you can get from https://www.python.org/downloads/

Procedural:
run the following:
python3 ./procedural_python_example.py ../data/data_file.txt

Pandas:
Pandas requires a little bit of work, 
first you'll need to install pip: python3 -m ensurepip
Next: install the dependencies: pip3 install -r requirements.txt

then you can run the file:
python3 ./pandas_example.py ../../data/data_file.txt
