The data generator creates a file of random elements in a list, with a 
percentage chance that it is taken from the uncommon list.


For example:
percent_chance = 5

Common list - 95% of all items will come from this list
Uncommon list - 5% of all items will come from this list


feel free to change any of the variables in the main method to generate different spreads of data.

max_len : the total number of items that has to be in the file
percent_chance: percentage chance that an item comes from uncommon
common: most common items to be output
uncommon: selected percent_chance of the time
